"Alum Pot","Description générale Alum Pot (NW and SE Routes):

NW route: 
The entirety of the shaft is descended with one hang, commencing at the north-west (NW) end (nearest to Long Churn caves).

SE Route:
Belay the rope to a tree a few metres from the ruined stile on the SE side of the shaft (as seen on approach from the cars). 
Then traverse along the edge to another tree overhanging the shaft which is the take-off point. 
A rebelay several metres down provides a clearer descent. 
From the landing point, a few direct routes of descent of the second part of the shaft are possible, or you can traverse along to reach the bottom of a huge sloping slab (The Bridge) to intercept the end of the traverse route coming from Dollytubs (on left at top of slab).

ALL ROUTES: 
At the bottom of all routes (SE, NW or from Dolly Tubs), a further downward pitch reaches a large passage which can be followed downstream. 
A final awkward climb down a waterfall can be bypassed via a slot down through blocks on the left leading into a descending rift. 
At the bottom, the water of Diccan Pot crashes down and flows straight down into a sump.
This is a draughty and impressive place","-2.34638","54.17543","Alum Pot, Selside Shaw Old Lane, Settle, England, BD24 0JA, United Kingdom"
